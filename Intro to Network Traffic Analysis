### If I wish to start a capture without hostname resolution, verbose output, showing contents in ASCII and hex, and grab the first 100 packets; what are the switches used? please answer in the order the switches are asked for in the question.

-nvXc 100

### Given the capture file at /tmp/capture.pcap, what tcpdump command will enable you to read from the capture and show the output contents in Hex and ASCII? (Please use best practices when using switches)



### What TCPDump switch will increase the verbosity of our output? ( Include the â€” with the proper switch )

-v
